A script to play with/explore the Collatz Conjecture, otherwise known as the 3n+1 problem.

The basic idea of the conjecture takes any odd number and multiplies it by 3 and adds 1 (3x+1). Any odd number is divided by two. The conjecture states that by following this pattern, any initial natural number given will eventually result in a 4-2-1 loop.

While a profoundly simple idea, the Collatz Conjecture is actually, at this time, is impossible to prove. This script comes nowhere near even attempting to prove this -- it is simply a tool to play around with the pattern and explore the patterns that can emerge from any starting number.
